Calculator CLI (Go)

A very simple command-line calculator written in Go.

This project was built as part of my first steps learning Go, specifically to understand:

Go modules and package structure

Basic command-line argument parsing

Functions, packages, and error handling

How Go enforces explicit, predictable code

It’s intentionally small and boring the goal is learning the language, not building a feature-rich calculator.
